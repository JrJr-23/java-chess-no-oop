# java-chess-no-oop

Built a complete chess game in Java without using object-oriented programming. The logic is fully procedural, relying on primitive arrays and manual control structures. While the code is rough and could be more efficient, the project reflects clear improvement in structure and readability as you scroll through it. It's a testament to my persistence, growth, and dedication to seeing projects through from start to finish — even when the challenge gets tough. I created this in 10th grade during my first year learning to code, when I was originally assigned to make a simple tic-tac-toe game — but I chose to push myself further by building a full chess engine instead. I did no research on absoulutely anything chess-coding wise, only using my own knowledge of problem solving and of the game of chess.

En passant was thought of, castling, discovered checks and more.
Only feature that was not implemented was checkmate- when a king is in checkmate, the board is frozen.

1. Open the project in Eclipse or any Java IDE
2. Compile and run the `main` class inside `/src`
3. Follow terminal prompts to play

My code to date is much, much, much cleaner than this. Classes could have been used more effictively to clean up the code. Again this is a brute-force approach which reflecting on I could clean up considerably.
